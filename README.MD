# GeoTools GIS Project
### A Comprehensive Guide to Your GIS Data Visualization and Manipulation Project

---

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of various tools and libraries for handling, visualizing, and customizing geographic data in Java. It involves working with shapefiles representing geographical boundaries and displaying them interactively using a map viewer. The project showcases your ability to work with GIS data, apply custom styling, and implement basic spatial analysis.

## Key Components

### 1. **Tools and Libraries Used**

1. **GeoTools:**
   - A powerful open-source library for working with geospatial data in Java.
   - Provides tools for reading and writing geospatial data formats (like shapefiles), performing spatial operations, and rendering maps.

2. **Maven:**
   - A build automation tool used for project management and dependency management.
   - Simplifies the process of managing libraries required for GeoTools and other dependencies.

3. **Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit):**
   - Used for GUI components, specifically for colors and dimensions in custom styles.
   - Facilitates visualization and user interaction within the map viewer.

4. **Natural Earth Dataset:**
   - A collection of free GIS data that provides shapefiles representing boundaries, landmarks, and other geographic information.
   - Served as the source for the geographic boundaries used in the project.

5. **JMapFrame (GeoTools Swing Module):**
   - A GeoTools component that provides a simple map viewer for displaying `MapContent`.
   - Enables interactive visualization, including zooming and panning features.

6. **StyleBuilder (GeoTools Styling Module):**
   - A utility class in GeoTools used to create and manipulate visual styles for displaying geographic features.
   - Allows the customization of colors, line styles, and feature symbology.

### 2. **Project Setup**

   - **Maven Configuration:** 
     - Set up a Maven project to manage dependencies and maintain a structured project environment.
     - Included essential GeoTools libraries for shapefile handling and visualization.

   - **Java Environment:** 
     - Configured the Java environment to ensure compatibility with GUI components and GeoTools functionalities.

### 3. **Shapefile Handling**

   - **Downloading Shapefiles:**
     - Acquired shapefiles from the Natural Earth dataset, focusing on country boundaries and maritime indicators.

   - **Loading Shapefiles:**
     - Utilized GeoTools' `DataStoreFinder` and `SimpleFeatureSource` to read shapefile data and access feature attributes and geometries.

### 4. **Attribute Exploration**

   - **Feature Attribute Analysis:**
     - Iterated through the shapefile features to extract and display attributes such as country names, boundary types, and geographical coordinates.

   - **Understanding Geometries:**
     - Analyzed the geometrical structure (e.g., `MULTILINESTRING`) of the shapefile features to comprehend their spatial representation.

### 5. **Data Visualization**

   - **Map Content Creation:**
     - Created a `MapContent` object to act as a container for various map layers, facilitating the organization and display of GIS data.

   - **Interactive Map Display:**
     - Implemented an interactive map viewer using `JMapFrame`, allowing for zooming, panning, and exploration of the loaded shapefiles.

### 6. **Custom Styling**

   - **Style Customization:**
     - Designed custom styles for map features using the `StyleBuilder` class.
     - Applied different colors, line widths, and transparency settings to visually distinguish various geographic features.

   - **Dynamic Style Application:**
     - Adapted styles dynamically to highlight specific regions or boundaries based on feature attributes.

### 7. **Troubleshooting and Optimization**

   - **Dependency Management:**
     - Resolved issues related to Maven dependencies, ensuring the inclusion of all necessary GeoTools libraries.

   - **Java Environment Issues:**
     - Addressed errors associated with `java.awt` imports by configuring the correct Java environment, ensuring full GUI functionality.

   - **Performance Optimization:**
     - Optimized the project to handle large shapefiles efficiently, maintaining smooth interaction and visualization performance.
